## Why Top Giants use Node.js

# Top Companies Using Node Js:
* NETFLIX
* UBER
* PAYPAL
* LINKEDIN
* AMAZON
* NASA
* WALMART
* EBAY

# What is NODE JS?
* First of all, NODE is NOT(I repeat is NOT) a `FRAMEWORK` or a `PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE`.
* `NODE JS` is a JAVASCRIPT RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT and it was introduced by Ryan Dahl in  2009. He used the Chrome v8 Engine which is a javascript Engine that converts JavaScript Code to Machine Code.
* It allows Us to Execute `JAVASCRIPT` outside the `BROWSER`.
* `NODE JS` was written using:
`JavaScript`,`CoffeeScript`,`C++(wiki)`

***

# Life Before Node JS:
* `JavaScript` runs only inside the `Browser`
* `JavaScript` was used for `FrontEnd developMent` only (Animation and Data Validtion).
* We can't run `JavaScript` outside the `Browser`

***

# Life after NODE JS:
* We can execute JavaScript outside the browser.
* JavaScript can be used for `Backend Development`.
* More job Offer for `JavaScript` Developers.

***

# Why NODE JS?
* `Super Fast`
* `Highly Scalable`
* `Used by Top Companies`

## Real Life examples -

**STATS**:- Paypal Switched from `JAVA` to `NODE` and here are the results:

üõ†Ô∏è**DEVELOPMENT**:
* Built almost twice as fast with fewer people.
* Written in 33% fewer lines of code.
* Constructed with 40% fewer files.

‚öôÔ∏è**PERFORMANCE**:
* Double the requests per second vs the Java application:

‚ö†Ô∏èThis is even more interesting because the initial performance results were using a SINGLE core for the node.js application compared to FIVE cores in javaü§Ø.
* 35% decrease in the average response time for the same page:

üí•This resulted in the pages being served 200ms faster (Something Users will definitely notice).
